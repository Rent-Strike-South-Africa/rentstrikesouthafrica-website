                                    <p><b>We have options.</b> </p>
                                    <p>There are two very useful pieces of information around legality to work with, thanks to the work of <a href="https://www.facebook.com/NdifunaUkwazi">Ndifuna Ukwazi</a>. Check out (1) <a href="https://www.facebook.com/RentStrikeSouthAfrica/posts/107402450926255">what happens when you can't pay your rent during lockdown</a>, and and (2) <a href="https://www.facebook.com/RentStrikeSouthAfrica/posts/107797447553422">this evictions infographic</a>. <br>There's also the important resource, <a href="https://evictions.org.za">evictions.org.za</a>, which can take you step-by-step through your options. <br>We don't have all the information - seems nobody does - but we will update this as we get more, and you should help by sending us what you learn! Here's the basic rundown on rent and bonds as we know it:</p>

									<h3 class="major">Residential Rent</h3>
									<p>For the period of the lockdown, it is illegal to evict anybody, and none are allowed to start a new eviction process. If the lockdown continues, these rules will remain in place – however you will still owe rent for the full period at the end of the lockdown.</p>
									<p>If you don’t pay, landlords are able to start an eviction process as soon as lockdown is over, and you would ordinarily have to pay all the rent you haven’t paid to remain in your home, unless you can successfully argue that the extreme circumstances warrant otherwise, which is an option, but not one we can guarantee.</p>
                                    <h3 class="major">Retail Rent</h3>
									<p>The law is the same for residential rent - however, some relief has already been granted from a large landord umbrella organisation - this can be read about <a href="https://businesstech.co.za/news/property/388259/south-african-landlords-announce-relief-for-retail-tenants/">here</a>. This does not include everyone, and should extend to the most vulnerable. You can help everyone by finding out exactly who gets what, and letting us know.</p>
									<h3 class="major">Bonds</h3>
									<p>Government-mandated debt relief has been granted in many sectors, but this appears not to extend to mortgages. People must not go further into debt during this period. We call for a full bond repayment holiday, with no added interest. Please build this platform with us, and join groups Ndifuna Ukwazi in supporting this call.</p>
                                    <p>Banks themselves have offered relief, and it appears in some cases to include mortgages. Please check in with your banks and find out, and get back to us with your findings. Let's take this forward together and get our banks on board for a full repayment holiday.</p>
                                    <p><b>Direct Help</b> </p>
                                    <p>Ndifuna Ukwazi has a super helpful dedicated legal person called Disha Govender who can be contacted during regular working hours over whatsapp at 081 832 9363 or over email at disha@nu.org.za. She is not affiliated with us directly but is available generally for legal advice in relation to housing as part of her work for her organisation.</p>
