										<h2 class="major">The call</h2>
										<p>
										<b>This May 1, very many of us will not be able to afford our rent. Though the lockdown is officially only 21 days, the pandemic will still be here after that period, and there are no guarantees that lockdown will not continue or that life will return to anything we are used to. You may not be in financial trouble now, but in a month or two, you may not be able to pay your rent, as thousands of people are already now incapable of doing. In more affected areas around the world, rent strikes have already begun. Their lives now are a glimpse of our future, and we can learn from their example and do even better.</b>
										</p>
										<p>
										This is a call for a rent strike. Organise with us, and when May comes, do not pay your rent and demand rent cancellation. If we remain isolated individuals, when COVID-19 is over, they’ll penalize or evict us one by one. The more people get involved, the less likely it is that the consequences will be serious for the strikers. The stakes are similar to a workplace strike or a student strike, but for tenants. We will flood the sheriffs and the courts with cases, and the government will be forced at least to call a rent freeze. For us to be able to fight this virus, we must not feel forced to work illegally or riot for the basic needs of food and housing.
									</p>
										<p>
										The best way for all of us to be safe is for all of us to participate. Social distancing helps stop the spread of COVID-19. It doesn’t stop us from taking the collective action of keeping our rent. We will strike until rent cancellation is granted, whether by our landlords or by the government. We will stand together and keep up the pressure to make our demands heard and to ensure that landlords cannot take action against their tenants. Our landlords will be fine, but we may not be.  As a group, landlords have more legal protections and more resources and we cannot be handing them money that we do not have to give or that we may need to survive if we remain unable to work.
									</p>
										<p>
										Similarly, property owners with bonds must collectively organise themselves, join calls from civil society organisations and demand from banks and government that they suspend payments, without charging interest.
									</p>
										<p>
										Major housing organisations and tenant unions are already on board, we have legal guidance on hand, and some major businesses are already striking. <b>They can’t evict us all, and if we do this right, they will evict none of us.</b>

										<h2 class="major">If you are an organisation</h2>
										<p>Get your members/constituency to organise. Be safe, contact everyone you know and get them on board. Make sure people know you are participating. The more we see and hear about the rent strike, and the more we hear of people who are committed to it, the more others will feel comfortable to join. Key members of organisations should join our working groups.</p>

											<p>Find the other tenants and organise them. Overwhelming a single landlord who is profiting off of your basic need for a place to leave is one of the most successful forms of rent strike in history.</p>

											<p>Spread the word. Think about your particular circumstances, whether it’s safe for you to participate. On May 1, if you can, withhold your rent, and prepare to stand in solidarity with all strikers if they try to come for us one by one.</p>
											<p>We already have support from various housing organisations and tenant unions across the Western Cape, and we have just begun to breathe this idea into the world. Get onboard.</p>
