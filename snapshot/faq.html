									<h3 class="major">What is a rent strike?</h3>
									<p>Crises are times to think big. Both elites in power and masses of everyday people have used crises as opportunities to push past what is normally considered politically possible, to promote big ideas that otherwise would not get a hearing. The idea of a “rent strike” is one such “big idea”, whose time has come.</p>
									<p>What is a “rent strike”? Essentially, it is the withholding of rent by renters in order to place demands on landlords (or society at large). Rent strikes are usually against particular landlords who act badly, but they aren’t necessarily limited to that. As argued below, due to the COVID-19 crisis now is the time to get organized as tenants to demand a suspension of rent and mortgages NOW, and to lay the groundwork for future organized opposition to the inhumane housing system that preceded the crisis.</p>
									<p>In the context of COVID-19, and the economic losses it presents, it is obvious that many people will not be able to pay their rent or mortgage due to loss of income. A suspension of housing payments seems perfectly sensible in the context, and indeed some in government are pursuing legal changes to prevent expected evictions and to support both renters and landlords in dealing with reduced income. People at ground level – tenants, the houseless, and their allies – are organizing to demand rent suspensions and promises not to evict directly from landlords, and petitioning governments to relieve people of rent burden and prevent negative fallout from non-payment.</p>
									<h3 class="major">Why keep my rent?</h3>
									<p>COVID-19 may be a long-term public health crisis. The number of people who have lost their jobs continues to grow. The pandemic is already making life harder for the majority of us, and we can’t afford to assume it is going away anytime soon. Thousands of us deciding to keep our rent gives us the resources to provide for the health and well-being of our families and communities.</p>
									<p>Further, banks and landlords should not be able to continue profiting on renters and mortgages when there is no way to earn money. That’s just common sense. If we can’t make money, neither can or landlords, neither can the banks.</p>
									<h3 class="major">I have funds to pay my rent, why should I take part?</h3>
									<p>Keeping our rent will be riskier for some people than others, especially if they are forced to do it alone. This makes it especially important for tenants in more secure positions to not only participate, but to commit to defending one another down the road, if needed. For the most marginalized among us, #RentStrikeSouthAfrica is not a choice — it’s a necessity. Either we need that money to feed our families, or we don't have sufficient income to begin with. If you are in a position to choose, please choose to stand with others who aren’t. #RentStrikeSouthAfrica is about acting together, so that those who are most marginalized are not left to deal with this crisis alone. The best way to support those who can't pay rent is for all of us to go on rent strike together, rendering it impossible for the authorities to target everyone who does not pay.</p>
									<h3 class="major">I live in a small building. Can I #rentstrike?</h3>
									<p>Tenants in small buildings or single units like basement apartments might feel isolated and less confident in keeping their rent. That’s why we’re creating ways for tenants to communicate online and by phone. Join in and stay in touch! By keeping your rent you make it possible for other tenants to feel more confident in keeping theirs. Ongoing communication will be critical for our ability to respond in cases requiring collective support.</p>
									<h3 class="major">The government has made lots of announcements. Can’t we just wait for rent relief?</h3>
									<p>The government has made a lot of announcements but they have not cancelled rent. If this happens, great. If it does not, this changes nothing. We still can’t pay, so we won’t. By keeping our rent, we take back authority over our lives and our families’ futures.</p>
									<h3 class="major">Why aren’t we pushing for stronger government action?</h3>
									<p>The clock is ticking. May 1st is around the corner. We can make this decision now. This decision will put more pressure on the government than any petition or letter to the editor AND we guarantee ourselves access to our own money. Two birds. One stone.</p>
									<h3 class="major">What about my landlord?</h3>
									<p>Landlords’ resources and legal protections will allow them to withstand the COVID-19 pandemic better than most, while tenants are more and more concerned with our daily survival. By keeping our rent we will have more money for groceries, medicine, disinfectant supplies, and other basic necessities. Our landlords will be fine without our rent. We may not be.</p>
									<h3 class="major">What should I do if I receive a letter or eviction notice from my landlord?</h3>
									<p>Landlords cannot evict anyone during the lockdown. They cannot even begin the process of eviction, which takes multiple weeks.</p>
									<p><i>After the lockdown, <a href="https://www.legalwise.co.za/help-yourself/quicklaw-guides/evictions">these are the steps</a> they would have to follow.</i></p>
									<h3 class="major">Should I try to negotiate with my landlord?</h3>
									<p>Yes. It is helpful to engage in a neutral attempt to level with your landlord and try to figure out how your landlord and fellow tenants can work together. Opening up lines of conversation, appeal to their sense of community, and encourage compassion to protect each other and what matters most in these unprecedented times. Ask them if they’ve leveraged all the resources available to them, such as: mortgage / loan forbearance or forgiveness; an insurance claim due to a natural disaster; flexible mortgage payments; tax write-offs or protections against investment loss. If they don’t have a mortgage, or can afford to let rent go unpaid, find out! Research your landlord and their real estate holdings, see if your landlord is a corporation or a management company with a federally backed loan. The more prepared you are going into any conversation with your landlord, the better.</p>
									<h3 class="major">Who can I contact for more support or questions about my specific case?</h3>
									<p>Come chat with us on our facebook page or over email - we'll try to send you in the right direction. Check out our resource page also on this site!</p>
									<h3 class="major">What is the long term vision for #rentstrike?</h3>
									<p>This is an evolving conversation. In the immediate, we know that rent payment is impossible without wages, and for many in our communities such expenses were already out of reach, exacerbated by the skyrocketing cost of living, gentrification and corporate speculation.</p>
									<p>As we confront the precarity of our economy at large, we ground into the ever-apparent truth that community control of land and housing and collective and cooperative ownership of resources are essential for resilience, stability, and survival. We support Community Land Trusts and co-operatives and encourage you to support the ones in your community.</p>
